### 3. Verify Integration

To verify that the integration is working:

2. Type: `Please search for Swiss locations named "Z端rich"`
3. Claude should use the MCP server to search for locations and return a formatted list

## Using the Weather Forecast

### Example Prompts

You can use natural language to ask for weather information:

#### Search for locations:
```
Can you find Swiss locations called "Bern"?
```

#### Get current weather:
```
What's the weather like in Z端rich today?
```

#### Get weather forecast for a specific date:
```
What will the weather be like in Bern on May 10th, 2025?
```

#### Get detailed forecast:
```
Give me a detailed hourly weather forecast for Z端rich for tomorrow.
```

### Viewing Resource Content

You can also directly reference resources:

```
Please show me the content of weather://Bern/2025-05-03
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the MCP integration:

1. **Server not found**: Ensure the path to the server is correct in the Claude Desktop settings
2. **API errors**: Check your internet connection since the server needs to connect to the LandiWetter API
3. **Command not running**: Make sure Node.js is installed and in your system PATH

## Advanced Usage

### Location IDs

After you search for a location, you'll get back location IDs. You can use these directly for more precise forecasts:

```
Please get the weather forecast for location ID G2661552
```

### Filtering Results

You can be specific about what information you want:

```
What's the precipitation probability in Z端rich for tomorrow?
```

This allows Claude to extract just the information you need from the rich weather data.

## Conclusion

The LandiWetter MCP server enhances Claude Desktop with the ability to provide accurate Swiss weather forecasts. By following this guide, you can get meteorological information directly in your chats without leaving the Claude interface.
